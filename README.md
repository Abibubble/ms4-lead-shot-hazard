## User Experience (UX)
### Initial Discussion
I wanted to create a website linked to a database, which allows users to login, search and find merchandise. This is something that Lead Shot Hazard has been discussing for a while, but we haven't had time to create until now.


### User Stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
As a first time visitor to this site, a user should be able to :
* Easily navigate the site.
* Intuitively and easily understand what to do.
* Register for an account.
* Search for a specific product.
* Browse through all merch.
* Get visual feedback when an action on the site is completed.


#### Returning Visitor Goals
In addition to the First Time Visitor Goals, a Returning Visitor should be able to :
* Log in.
* Be confident that the user's password is be stored securely.
* Navigate intuitively, with no need to use the browser's back button.


#### Admin Goals
In addition to the First Time and Returning Visitor Goals, as an administrator of this site, an admin user should be able to :
* Be confident that a user can't to brute force their way into the restricted pages.
* Edit any product.
* Delete any product.
* Add a new product.


### Project Goals
* This project has the goal of demonstrating my understanding of maintaining a database attached to a website, with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functionality.
* MORE GOALS

## Deployment
### Requirements for Deployment
* Python
* AWS S3 account
* GitHub account
* Heroku account


### Initial Deployment

SECRET_KEY - This is a custom string set up to keep sessions secure. I recommend using a 'Fork Knox' level password generated by [RandomKeygen](https://randomkeygen.com/).

This site was deployed to Heroku by following these steps:

1. Heroku needs to be told what the requirements are for this project, so go into your GitPod terminal, and create files to explain the requirements by using the following commands:
    * `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
    * `echo web: python run.py > Procfile` - Ensure there is no blank line after the contents of this file
2. Push these changes to your repository.
6. Login or sign up to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
7. Select 'Create New App' in the top right of your dashboard.
8. Choose a unique app name, and select the region closest to you, before clicking 'Create App'.
9. Go to the 'Deploy' tab, find 'Deployment Method' and select 'GitHub'.
10. Search to find your GitHub repository, and click 'Connect'. Don't enable automatic deployment yet, as this can cause errors.
11. Go to the 'Settings' tab, find 'Config Vars', and click 'Reveal Config Vars'.
12. Enter key value pairs that match those in your env.py file, displayed like this :

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| SECRET_KEY | ## YOUR SECRET_KEY ## |

13. Go to the 'Deploy' tab, and click 'Enable Automatic Deployment'.
14. In 'Manual Deploy', choose which branch you'd like to deploy from (I chose 'master' branch, this is also known as 'main').
15. Click 'Deploy Branch' to deploy your app onto the Heroku servers.
16. Once the app has finished building, click 'Open App' to open your site.


### How to Fork it
1. Login or Sign Up to [GitHub](www.github.com).
2. On GitHub, go to [Abibubble/ms4-lead-shot-hazard](https://github.com/Abibubble/ms4-lead-shot-hazard).
3. In the top right, click "Fork".
4. You will need to create an env.py file with your own values, and create a MongoDB database with the data keys and types as shown above.
5. You will also need to install all of the project requirements. This can be done using the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Type `python3 manage.py runserver` in your GitPod terminal to run your local site of this project.


### Making a Local Clone
1. Log in to [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and locate the [Repository](https://github.com/Abibubble/ms4-lead-shot-hazard) for this site.
2. Under the repository name, above the list of files, click "Code".
3. Here you can either Clone or Download the repository.
4. You should clone the repository using HTTPS, clicking on the icon to copy the link.
5. Open Git Bash.
6. Change the current working directory to the new location, where you want the cloned directory to be.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL that was copied in Step 4.
7. Press Enter, and your local clone will be created.
8. You will need to create an env.py file with your own values, and create a MongoDB database with the data keys and types as shown above.
9. You will also need to install all of the project requirements. This can be done using the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
10. Type `python3 app.py` in your GitPod terminal to run your local site of this project.


For a more detailed version of these steps, go to the [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop) page on this topic.

## Testing
### W3C Validator
W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator, JSHint, and PEP8 Online were used to validate the project to ensure there were no syntax errors within the site.

1. W3C HTML Markup Validator
    * [Homepage](LINK)
    * Unfortunately, as it's not possible to log in using the Validator, it was only possible to test the pages available to a user who isn't logged in.

2. W3C CSS Validator
    * [Homepage](LINK)
    * Unfortunately, as it's not possible to log in using the Validator, it was only possible to test the pages available to a user who isn't logged in.

3. JSHint
