## Automated Testing

Automated Unit Testing was done using [Djangoâ€™s testing tools](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/testing/) and [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)'s continuous integration testing functionality.

### Django Testing

* Overall I was very happy with the level of coverage I got on this project.
* Some lines of code were omitted from coverage using `# pragma: no cover`, due to them either being code that's populated by Django, code in the settings.py file to connect to environment variables, or non-important code to the function of the site.
* [Click here to view the full testing coverage report](testing/automated/full-coverage.png).

* The Bag App `contexts.py` file has a few lines of omitted code, as these are either from the Code Institute Boutique Ado walkthrough, or are simply defining variables.
* The Band App `test_views.py` file has been omitted, as this is just testing code.
* The Checkout App `update_total`, `__str__()` and `save` functions have been omitted, as these are taken from the Code Institute Boutique Ado walkthrough.
* The Checkout App `signals.py` file has been omitted, as this sets up the basic update functionality that is used in other files, which is clear to be working because other functions wouldn't work without it.
* The Checkout App `test_models.py` file has been omitted, as this is just testing code.
* The Checkout App `cache_checkout_data` function has been omitted, as this Code is from the Code Institute Boutique Ado walkthrough and Stripe.
* The Checkout App `webhook_handler.py` and `webhooks.py` files have been omitted, as this Code is from the Code Institute Boutique Ado walkthrough and Stripe.
* The Products App `__init__()` function has been omitted, as this code is not necessary to the functionality of the site.
* One line in the Profiles App `__init__()` function has been omitted, as this code is not necessary to the functionality of the site.
* The Profiles App `models.py` still has one line of omitted code - the `__str__()` function. I could not find a place where this function was called across the site.
* Various lines from the `settings.py` file have been omitted, as these set the variables for use throughout the site, and do not require testing.

A large amount of manual testing was done to ensure that all pages were displayed correctly at all screen sizes, and all functionality worked as it should. Friends, family members, and other developers were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues that they came across.

Responsive design was tested from 320px to 2500px, to account for the smallest of mobile devices, and the largest of monitors that the general public would be using.

| G2 | Site User - Be confident that my password is stored securely - Feel safe from malicious activity | Django and Google store all passwords securely, so that even the site owner will never see the user's password |
| G3 | Site Owner - Be confident of the security of the restricted pages - Feel safe from malicious activity | The superuser is set through Django, so there can only be one. If a logged-out user tried to access a restricted page, it directs them to the log in page. If a logged-in user without access rights tries to access a restricted page, it redirects them to the homepage and presents them with a message informing them of this. |

### Testing technologies

* HTML was validated using [W3C HTML Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
* CSS was validated using [W3C Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
* JavaScript was validated using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).
* Python was validated using [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).
* Responsive design was tested using a variety of devices, as listed above in [Full devices and browsers](#full-devices-and-browsers), as well as being tested with [Google Chrome's Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [Am I Responsive Design](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#), and [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/).
* Accessibility was checked via [WebAim's W.A.V.E](https://wave.webaim.org/), [WebAIM's Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), and [Google Chrome's Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).
* [Toptal Color-Blind Filter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/) was used to check that the site was suitable for color-blind users, as well as manually testing it with my color-blind partner.
* Unit Testing was done using [Djangoâ€™s testing tools](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/testing/) and [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)'s continuous integration testing functionality.

1. W3C HTML Markup Validator

2. W3C CSS Validator
    * [Homepage](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fms4-lead-shot-hazard.herokuapp.com%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

    * Unfortunately, as it's not possible to log in using the Validator, it was only possible to test the pages available to a user who isn't logged in.

3. JSHint
    * [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
    * The only comments from JSHint are about template literals, the `let` keyword, and the `$` from jQuery, all of which are JSHint making the developer aware that those features aren't available outside of ES6 and jQuery.
    * There are no JavaScript errors in this project.
    * Stripe payments
    * ![JSHint results for Stripe payments](testing/validator/stripe.png)
    * Social media icon hover functions
    * ![JSHint results for social media hover functions](testing/validator/socials.png)

    * ![JSHint results for quantity input functionality](testing/validator/quantity-input.png)

4. Flake8
    * [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/)
    * `Class 'x' has no 'objects' member` and `Class 'UserProfile' has no 'DoesNotExist' member`:
        * These are just warnings from pylint. Django adds the `objects` and 'DoesNotExist' properties to all model classes, so the IDE isn't aware of this.
    * `Avoid using null=True on string-based fields such CharField`:
        * This error is there to avoid a field having two values if left blank - an empty string, and `null`. This would usually be a valid error, but because I need to allow empty values in forms, this is required, as the `null` parameter only affects database storage.
    * There are also several warnings being shown from the migrations files. These are acceptable to ignore, as they are created by Django, and [this issue has been marked as a 'won't fix'](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/30555) by the Django team.

## Accessibility

### Tap Targets

* All tap targets are a minimum of 40px width and 40px height, to comply with WCAG Accessibility standards.
* All tap targets have a minimum of an 8px gap between them, to avoid any overlapping tap targets.

### Color Contrast

* All background and foreground colors have a sufficient contrast ratio.
* This site has been checked by a user with deuteranopia color blindness with no issues present.
* [Toptal Color-Blind Filter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/) was used to check every accessible page against every type of color-blindness, with no issues present. Unfortunately, the checker doesn't support logging in, so the logged-in-only pages were not able to be checked this way.
* All color contrasts were checked using [WebAIM's Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), with all large-scale text having a contrast ratio of at least 3:1, and all other text having a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.

### Visually-Impaired Users

* All images have meaningful alt text.
* All icons have an aria-label to describe them unless semantic text is also visible.
* All buttons that need more description for a visually-impaired user have an aria-labelledby attribute attached to them if required.

### Assistive Technologies

* All actions are keyboard-focusable.
* All interactable elements have hover and focus styling applied to them.
* All images have meaningful alt text for screen reader users.
* All icons have an aria-label to describe them unless semantic text is also visible.

### Reading Level

* All text content on the site has a maximum reading level of age 11 using the Automated Readability Index (ARI), to aid people with cognitive impairments, and people who don't speak English as a first language, among others.
* While this isn't ideal, as the recommended maximum reading level is age 9, given the site is for a ska punk band with swear words in their songs, I decided that this was an acceptable level to be at.
* All text content on this site has been tested against the ARI on [Readability Formulas](https://readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php).
* The full report of all text on the site can be viewed in the [Readability Checker Results file](READABILITY.md).

## Site Performance and Optimisation

Upon speaking to [Chris Anstey](https://github.com/ansteychris), a Digital Experience Lead at Google, he recommended testing with both Lighthouse and WebPageTest. Whilst they both test for the same things, Lighthouse often suffers from inaccurate readings for a wide variety of reasons. This ranges from how many browser tabs / windows you have open while you're doing the test, to how well your internet speed is performing that day. WebPageTest bypasses all of these issues, as it tests externally.

### Lighthouse

I tested my website using DevTools Lighthouse feature, and got these results:

#### Desktop Lighthouse

![Lighthouse desktop first try](testing/lighthouse-desktop.png)

#### Mobile Lighthouse

![Lighthouse mobile first try](testing/lighthouse-mobile.png)

#### Performance Lighthouse

* On mobile screens, this score was brought down due to the images not being of a set width and height. This is because I wanted the images to be fully responsive, so explicit width and height have not been set to achieve this.
* Besides this issue on mobile, I was happy with this score.

#### Accessibility Lighthouse

* I was very happy with this score.
* Please see the [Accessibility section](#accessibility) for full details of the steps I took to ensure this site was fully accessible.

#### Best Practices Lighthouse

* I was very happy with this score.
* All external links are secure.
* All images are displayed with the correct aspect ratio and resolution.
* There are no issues in the Devtools Issues panel.

#### SEO Lighthouse

* I was very happy with this score.
* All relevant meta tags were included.
* Each page has different meta tags, to relate to the page content.
* All links have descriptive text.

### WebPageTest

I tested my website using WebPageTest, and got these results:

* [WebPageTest Results](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/211025_BiDc17_4454be0499acb618820ee9541dd16b2a/)

## Images

In some of the images, the footer is hovering in the middle of the page content. This is an issue with the screenshotting tools on various browsers, rather than an issue with the site. Please disregard these issues, as they do not match the site itself.
