### Testing technologies

* HTML was validated using [W3C HTML Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
* CSS was validated using [W3C Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).
* JavaScript was validated using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).
* Python was validated using [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/) and [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).
* Accessibility was checked via [WebAim's W.A.V.E](https://wave.webaim.org/), [WebAIM's Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), and [Google Chrome's Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).
* [Toptal Color Blind Filter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/) was used to check that the site was suitable for color blind users, as well as manually testing it with my color blind partner.
* Unit Testing was done using [Djangoâ€™s testing tools](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/testing/).

1. W3C HTML Markup Validator
    * [Homepage](LINK)
    * Unfortunately, as it's not possible to log in using the Validator, it was only possible to test the pages available to a user who isn't logged in.

2. W3C CSS Validator
    * [Homepage](LINK)
    * Unfortunately, as it's not possible to log in using the Validator, it was only possible to test the pages available to a user who isn't logged in.

3. JSHint
    * [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
    * EXPLANATIONS
    * ![Image of JSHint results](static/docs/img/jshint.png)

4. PEP8 Online
    * [PEP8 Online](http://pep8online.com/)
    * `Class 'x' has no 'objects' member` and `Class 'UserProfile' has no 'DoesNotExist' member`:
        * These are just warnings from pylint. Django adds the `objects` and 'DoesNotExist' properties to all model classes, so the IDE isn't aware of this.
    * `Avoid using null=True on string-based fields such CharField`:
        * This error is there to avoid a field having two values if left blank - an empty string, and `null`. This would usually be a valid error, but because I need to allow empty values in forms, this is required, as the `null` parameter only affects database storage.

    * Add more than 99 of a product into their bag.
* Password validation
  * When a user is registering for an account, the site ensures no typos happen by prompting the user to enter the password twice, with the site checking to confirm that the passwords match.
* Email validation
  * When a user is registering for an account, the site ensures the correct email address has been entered by sending a verification email to the email address the user has supplied.
  * The account cannot be used until the user has verified that their email address is correct by following the link in the validation email.
* Image validation
  * A default image will display if there is no image added.
  * A default image will display if the image link has broken.
* Page validation
  * A custom 404 error page will show if the user attempts to visit a page that doesn't exist.

  * Webhooks form a notification system for every secure action on your site.
  * Webhooks return an event object, containing all the relevant information about the action, including the type of action, and the data associated with it.
  * If the user leaves the page before the order is complete but the payment goes through, the billing details and shipping address will be sent with the payment, and can be accessed via the webhooks.

## Accessibility

### Tap Targets

* All tap targets are a minimum of 40px width and 40px height, to comply with WCAG Accessibility standards.
* All tap targets have a minimum of an 8px gap between them, to avoid any overlapping tap targets.

### Color Contrast

* All background and foreground colors have a sufficient contrast ratio.
* This site has been checked by a user with deuteranopia color blindness with no issues present.
* [Toptal Color Blind Filter](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/) was used to check every accessible page against every type of color blindness, with no issues present. Unfortunately, the checker doesn't support loggin in, so the logged in only pages were not able to be checked this way.
* All color contrasts were checked using [WebAIM's Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/), with all large-scale text having a contrast ratio of at least 3:1, and all other text having a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.

### Visually-Impaired Users

* All images have meaningful alt text.
* All icons have an aria-label to describe them, unless semantic text is also visible.
* All buttons that need more description for a visually-impaired user have an aria-labelledby attribute attached to them.

### Assistive Technologies

* All actions are keyboard-focusable.
* All interactable elements have hover and focus styling applied to them.

### Reading Level

* All text content on the site has a maximum reading level of age 9 using the Automated Readability Index (ARI), to aid people with cognitive impairments, and people who don't speak English as a first language, among others.
* All text content on this site has been tested against the ARI on [Readability Formulas](https://readabilityformulas.com/free-readability-formula-tests.php).
* The full report of all text on the site can be viewed in [Readability Checker Results](static/docs/READABILITY.md)

## Site Performance and Optimisation

Upon speaking to [Chris Anstey](https://github.com/ansteychris), a Digital Experience Lead at Google, he recommended testing with both Lighthouse and WebPageTest. Whilst they both test for the same things, Lighthouse often suffers from inaccurate readings for to a wide variety of reasons. This ranges from how many browser tabs / windows you have open while you're doing the test, to how well your internet speed is performing that day. WebPageTest bypasses all of these issues, as it tests externally.

### Lighthouse

I tested my website using DevTools Lighthouse feature, and got these results:

#### Desktop Lighthouse
